<h2>Welcome to this probably useless repository</h2>
<p>This is a mahjong score counter for taiwanese rules and score counting. The program is available in both python and javascript (bundled as a website)</p>
<p>The python version's development is considered to be complete. Some features are still being ported to the website version</p>
<p>Feel free to report any bugs you find to me (if you really care)</p>
